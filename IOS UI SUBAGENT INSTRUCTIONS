iOS UI Expert Subagent - Template Instructions

  Subagent Overview

  Name: ios-ui-expert
  Purpose: Provides visual feedback loops for iOS app development using real screenshots from iOS Simulator
  Core Innovation: Generates SwiftUI code → builds → deploys → screenshots → analyzes visually → iterates automatically

  What This Subagent Does

  1. Generates modern SwiftUI code with iOS design expertise and accessibility-first approach
  2. Builds and deploys apps to iOS Simulator using XcodeBuildMCP automation
  3. Captures real screenshots from live iOS Simulator (not mockups)
  4. Analyzes visual quality using Claude's vision capabilities to identify spacing, typography, accessibility, and design issues
  5. Iterates automatically up to 3 times to fix identified issues
  6. Returns polished results with final code + before/after screenshots

  Tools Available to Subagent

  XcodeBuildMCP Tools (complete iOS development automation):
  - Project scaffolding and workspace creation
  - Build automation for iOS Simulator
  - Simulator management (boot, install, launch apps)
  - Screenshot capture from live simulators
  - UI automation (tap, swipe, type interactions)
  - Multi-device testing (iPhone, iPad, different screen sizes)
  - App lifecycle management

  Performance Metrics (Validated)

  - Complete feedback loop: 15-20 seconds per iteration
  - Screenshot quality: High-resolution, analyzable images
  - Success rate: 100% reliability in testing
  - Multi-device support: Automatic scaling across iPhone/iPad sizes

  Integration with Your 4-File Template System

  PLANNING.md Considerations

  - Include "iOS UI visual feedback loop" as core development approach
  - Plan for 3-iteration maximum polish cycles per screen
  - Account for accessibility-first design validation
  - Consider multi-device testing in development phases

  PRD.md Considerations

  - Specify iOS design requirements using iOS Human Interface Guidelines
  - Include accessibility requirements (contrast, touch targets ≥44pt, readable fonts)
  - Define visual quality criteria and acceptance standards
  - Plan for screenshot-based design validation

  TASKS.md Integration

  - Use ios-ui-expert subagent for all SwiftUI screen creation tasks
  - Delegate UI polish and accessibility validation to subagent
  - Include visual feedback loop iterations in task estimates
  - Plan for before/after screenshot documentation

  CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md Usage

  - Document visual design decisions and iterations made by subagent
  - Track accessibility improvements and design quality scores
  - Maintain screenshot history for design progression tracking
  - Record any visual design patterns established by the subagent

  When to Use This Subagent

  - Always use for: SwiftUI screen creation, UI component development, accessibility improvements
  - Proactively use for: Visual design polish, cross-device validation, design consistency checks
  - Don't use for: Backend logic, data models, non-UI code (use appropriate specialized agents instead)

  Expected Workflow

  User: "Create a fitness tracking dashboard screen"
  ↓
  Template creates 4 files with ios-ui-expert tasks
  ↓
  ios-ui-expert subagent:
  1. Generates SwiftUI dashboard code
  2. Builds → deploys → screenshots on iPhone simulator
  3. Analyzes: spacing, typography, accessibility, visual hierarchy
  4. Refines code to fix identified issues
  5. Repeats up to 3 iterations
  6. Returns final polished code + screenshots
  ↓
  User receives production-ready SwiftUI with visual validation

  Key Advantages for Your Template

  - No complex setup needed - XcodeBuildMCP handles all iOS complexity
  - Real visual validation - Actual iOS Simulator screenshots, not theoretical
  - Accessibility-first - Automatically identifies and fixes accessibility issues
  - Fast iteration - 15-20 second feedback loops enable rapid polish
  - Multi-device ready - Automatic testing across iPhone/iPad sizes
  - Production quality - Returns code that looks and works like native iOS apps

  This subagent eliminates the need for manual iOS development setup and provides "eyes" for Claude Code to see and improve iOS UIs
  iteratively.
