Claude Code 4-File Framework Template Prompts
Initial Questions Template
Before creating your 4-file framework, answer these questions to help Claude understand your project:
Project Definition
What problem does your app solve? (Be specific about the pain point)
Who is the target user? (Yourself, specific group, everyone?)
What is your timeline? (1 day, 1 week, 1 month?)
What platform/device is critical? (iPhone, desktop, both?)
Core Functionality
List 3-5 must-have features (What makes this app useful?)
What can you live without? (Features to cut for speed)
What's your "definition of done"? (When is v1 complete?)
Technical Constraints
What's your technical skill level? (Helps Claude adjust complexity)
Any required integrations? (Specific services, APIs, databases?)
Deployment preference? (Vercel, Netlify, self-hosted?)
Scope Control
Is this a prototype or production app? (Affects quality tradeoffs)
Single user or multi-user? (Affects auth and data structure)
How important is polish vs functionality? (Design priorities)

Prompt 1: PRD (Product Requirements Document)
Think hard. Help me create a PRD for [APP TYPE] that [CORE FUNCTIONALITY] - optimized for [TARGET PLATFORM] - with [KEY FEATURES].

App identity:
- Name: [APP NAME]
- Form factor: [WEB/MOBILE/DESKTOP]
- Primary use: [MAIN PURPOSE]
- Timeline: [BUILD TIMELINE]

Target users & jobs:
- [WHO USES IT]
- Jobs: [WHAT THEY NEED TO DO]

MVP scope:
- Must have: [CRITICAL FEATURES]
- Nice to have: [FEATURES IF TIME]
- Out of scope: [WHAT TO SKIP]

Core flows:
- [USER JOURNEY 1]
- [USER JOURNEY 2]
- [USER JOURNEY 3]

Technical constraints:
- Stack: [PREFERRED STACK]
- Deployment: [WHERE TO DEPLOY]
- Timeline: [DEADLINE]

Deliverables:
Create a concise, implementation-ready PRD with these sections:
1. Problem & goals
2. Users & jobs
3. In-scope (MVP) vs out-of-scope
4. Information architecture & routes
5. UX requirements
6. System architecture
7. Data model
8. Acceptance criteria
9. Technical decisions
10. Build order/milestones

Keep it lean and actionable. This is for Claude Code to build quickly. Cut anything that isn't essential for v1.


Prompt 2: CLAUDE.md File
Think hard. Now generate a CLAUDE.md file from this PRD that will guide future Claude Code sessions on this project.

This file should include:

1. Critical session rules that Claude Code MUST follow every time:
   - How to start each session (reading planning.md, tasks.md)
   - File management rules (check before creating)
   - Task management protocol (how to mark complete)
   - Development workflow (TDD or speed-first)

2. Code standards appropriate for the timeline:
   - If 1-day build: relaxed standards, any types OK
   - If production: strict standards required
   - Component patterns to follow
   - State management approach

3. Project-specific guidelines:
   - Tech stack patterns
   - Common code snippets
   - Error handling approach
   - Testing requirements (or lack thereof)

4. Session management:
   - How to handle context limits
   - Session summary template
   - What to document

5. Common pitfalls to avoid

Make sure this file keeps Claude Code on track and prevents it from over-engineering or going rogue. The goal is consistent, focused development sessions.


Prompt 3: PLANNING.md File
Think hard. Create a planning.md file that includes:
* vision
* architecture  
* technology stack
* required tools list

Structure it as:

1. Project Vision
   - Mission statement (1-2 sentences)
   - Core principles (what matters most)
   - Success metrics (how we know it's working)

2. Architecture (keep it simple)
   - High-level system overview
   - Directory structure
   - No complex patterns unless necessary

3. Technology Stack
   - Core dependencies (minimal)
   - What we're using and why
   - What we're NOT using (to avoid scope creep)

4. Required Tools & Setup
   - Minimum requirements
   - Quick setup commands
   - Configuration steps
   - Deployment process

5. Development Approach
   - Hour-by-hour plan (if applicable)
   - Copy-paste templates
   - Quick decision matrix

Remember: This is for [TIMELINE] build. Every decision should optimize for [SPEED/QUALITY]. Include only what's needed to ship v1.


Prompt 4: TASKS.md File
Think hard. Create a tasks.md file with bullet point tasks divided into milestones for building this app.

Requirements:
- Break into time-based milestones (Hour X, Day X, or Week X based on timeline)
- Each task should be 5min - 2hr max
- Include time estimates [5m], [30m], [1h], [2h]
- Mark priority: 🔴 Critical, 🟡 High, 🟢 Normal, ⚪ Skip

Structure:

## Milestone 1: [FOUNDATION]
*Goal: [What works after this milestone]*
- [ ] Task with [TIME]
- [ ] Task with [TIME]

## Milestone 2: [CORE FEATURE 1]
*Goal: [What works after this milestone]*
- [ ] Task with [TIME]

[Continue for all milestones]

## If Time Permits (Bonus)
- [ ] Nice to have features

## Skip These (Too Complex)
- [ ] [SKIP] Features to avoid

## Emergency Shortcuts
- If running out of time, do X instead of Y

## Copy-Paste Code Blocks
[Include helpful code snippets]

Total the tasks and time at the bottom. Be realistic about what can be built in [TIMELINE].


How to Use This Framework
First: Answer the initial questions to clarify your project
Second: Use your answers to fill in the variables in each prompt
Third: Give Claude each prompt in order (PRD → CLAUDE.md → PLANNING.md → TASKS.md)
Fourth: Save all 4 files in your project root
Fifth: Start Claude Code with: "Please read planning.md, claude.md, and tasks.md to understand the project. Then complete the first task from tasks.md."
Pro Tips:
For 1-day builds: Emphasize speed over quality in all prompts
For production apps: Add testing and quality requirements
Always include "Think hard" - it improves Claude's output
Keep the PRD under 2000 words for best results
Update tasks.md as you discover new requirements
This framework ensures Claude Code stays focused, doesn't hallucinate features, and builds exactly what you need.
