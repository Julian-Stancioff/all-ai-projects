# all-ai-projects

This repository contains descriptions of Julian Stancioff’s AI projects.
	•	All projects are currently closed-source due to active development, client work, or proprietary frameworks.
	•	However, detailed project descriptions, architectures, and technical stacks are provided here to showcase the breadth of work.

I am also documenting my progress in the 10 Apps in 10 Weeks Challenge — a personal commitment to rapidly prototype and launch one new app per week. I was caught mid-way through week 2, but I’ve included the full challenge plan below to give a sense of my roadmap.

Current AI Projects (Closed Source)

1. iOS UI MCP – AI-Powered iOS Development Tool

An AI agent that generates SwiftUI UIs with visual feedback loops. Instead of blindly generating code, it runs in the iOS Simulator, takes screenshots, and iterates until the UI meets Apple HIG and accessibility standards.

Tech stack: Swift 6.1+, SwiftUI, XcodeBuildMCP, Claude Code, Computer Vision (for layout + WCAG compliance).

⸻

2. HouseShare Music App

An iOS app for sharing unreleased house music tracks among friends. Includes upload, playback, playlist management, and Firebase authentication.

Tech stack: SwiftUI, Firebase, AVAudioPlayer, Core Data.

⸻

3. Pet Scanner w/ Rarity Scores

A prototype app that scans pets (dogs, cats, exotics) and assigns a rarity score + metadata. Combines image recognition with simple gamification elements.

Tech stack: Python, OpenCV, Vercel, Claude Code.

⸻

4. Symptom & Injury Tracker

An AI-driven health logging app that makes tracking injuries and symptoms easy and structured. Logs are vectorized for downstream AI analysis and produce daily/weekly summaries.

Tech stack: SwiftUI, LangChain, Pinecone, GPT-4.

🏁 10 Apps in 10 Weeks Challenge

Here’s the roadmap of app ideas I plan to build over 10 weeks. Some are fun prototypes, others are serious utility apps.
	1.	Fitness App – AI-guided training plans to achieve specific physique goals.
	2.	Meal Planner App – Scan pantry/fridge with video → auto-generate recipes + grocery lists.
	3.	Symptom/Injury Tracker – Already underway (see above).
	4.	Plant Age Estimator – Take a picture → AI predicts plant’s age + health score.
	5.	Pet Age/Breed Guesser – Photo → AI predicts pet’s breed mix + age (with confidence %).
	6.	Anti-Procrastination App – Listens for keystrokes/mic activity → nudges you when idle.
	7.	Contract Clarity – Upload a lease/contract → highlights red flags + auto-generates questions.
	8.	Day Architect – Goal + calendar manager that breaks your day into optimized time slots.
	9.	Prediction Models – Sports betting & NFL game prediction app (extendable to stocks).
	10.	Get Ready for Sleep Suite – Apps for wind-down writing, caffeine tracking, and soundscape creation.

Bonus App Ideas (Future Pipeline)
	•	Dermatology/Hair Loss Diagnosis (consumer AI health app)
	•	Stop Vaping Habit Tracker (gamified quitting tool)
	•	Beverage ABV % Tracker (similar to Beer Buddy, with AI enhancements)
	•	Sun Exposure Skin Tone Tracker
	•	Visual Text/Concept Explainer (AI diagrams + narration)
	•	Furniture Assembly Visualizer
	•	Emoji Generator from Facial Expressions
	•	Everyday AI Concierge – Your AI personal assistant for bookings, errands, and calls
	•	Gamified Procrastination + Habit Apps

⸻

Purpose
	•	Showcase my AI-first approach to app development.
	•	Build fast, ship fast — 10 MVPs in 10 weeks.
	•	Create engaging documentation for accelerators, collaborators, and future users.
	•	Use this repo as a living portfolio: new apps and updates will be added weekly.
